//make a clock, set the time to zero

//access the array of windows we made in main, initialize them as empty

//array of windows that exist, and the time left that the occupied ones will be in use

//pop students from queue but ONLY if there is an open window and the clock is at their time

//when we pop a student also give them the attribute of difference between current time and time arrived

//when the student is done we will push them to an array the size of total student count, and increment the number of students that are done
